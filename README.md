# Computer_System_Architectures

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the Computer System Architectures course at Politecnico di Torino. This course focuses on understanding the fundamental principles of processor design and functionality, with an emphasis on low-level programming and system simulation.

Throughout the course, we will delve into the study of processor architectures, exploring concepts such as instruction sets, pipeline stages, memory hierarchy, and system performance optimization. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to practical exercises, where we will write and debug code in Assembly 64x64, providing a hands-on approach to learning processor functionality.

To support these activities, we will use tools such as:

WINMIPS64 for understanding pipeline simulation and instruction flow,
Keil for ARM-based programming,
GEM5 for advanced architectural simulations.
This repository will serve as a log of my weekly Lab Assignments, tracking my progress and showcasing my learning journey. Each submission will reflect the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired during the course.

Feel free to explore, comment, or contribute if you share a passion for computer system architectures!
